# Medichatbot
Medichatbot is a Natural language AI that can converse and have a conversation with a patient to take the inputted diseases/symptoms the patient has to reccomend a certain workflow for the patient to recover. This will be useful for places all over the world where proper medicinal advice is absent and is not intended to replace doctors.

This takes the path of telecommunication to aid those who are unable to reach medical advice.
This code will somewhat mimic chat gpt and drug gpt which already exist but this sees room for improvement.
